LeagueRecord automatically detects when a League of Legends game is running and records it. \
Currently only supports Windows.

Downloads are available on the [Releases](https://github.com/FFFFFFFXXXXXXX/league_record/releases) page as an installer (\*.msi file) or as a portable version (\*.zip file)

## Usage

<!-- ![screenshot1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37913466/187545060-f97961f2-346d-48b7-bf1b-c453cbd86776.png) -->

LeagueRecord launches minimized to the windows tray to get out of your way.

![screenshot-tray](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37913466/258664950-89779fd8-293a-42ed-be8c-95443bde2490.png)

Right-clicking the LeagueRecord tray item opens a menu.

![screenshot-tray-menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37913466/258588802-c91c5cee-4192-4398-8582-bad709760e48.png)

1. The topmost grayed out "Recording" entry has a checkmark next to it if your game is currently being recorded.
2. The 'Settings' button opens the LeagueRecord settings in the windows text editor. See [Settings](#settings) for more information.
3. The 'Open' button opens a window that shows you all your recordings.
4. The 'Quit' button stops LeagueRecord completely.

Double left-clicking the LeagueRecord tray icon or clicking 'right-click' -> 'Open' in the tray menu opens a window that shows all your recordings.

There are 3 parts to the window.

1. At the top left there is a small info that shows you how much space your recordings take up as well as a box with a button to open the folder in which your recordings are stored.
2. On the left side under the info box there is a list of all you recordings. The name of each recording is the timestamp of the game.
    Clicking on a recording shows it in the right part of the window. When moving your mouse over a recording there is a button to mark a recording as a 'favorite' (see [Settings](#settings)).
    There are also buttons to rename or delete a recording.
3. The right part of the window shows the currently selected recording with some information about the game at the bottom.
    The timeline of the video includes colored markers for the most important events that happened in the game.
    In case you don't want to see ALL events because they clutter the timeline you can enable/disable them by clicking the corresponding checkbox on the bottom right.

Just closing the window doesn't completely stop LeagueRecord because it needs to run in the background to record your games.
In order to completely stop LeagueRecord you have to right-click the tray-icon at the bottom right of your screen and click the 'Quit' button.

> [!NOTE]
> A bunch of stuff can be customized in the [Settings](#settings). Video resolution, framerate, record voice-comms or only game audio, autostart LeagueRecord when you turn on your PC, ...  

> [!NOTE]
> In case LeagueRecord only records a black screen instead of the game, try running the software as Admin. That should fix the Problem!

## Settings

It is possible to adjust the settings via the settings button in the tray menu.
It opens the settings file in the windows text editor.\
Settings get applied as soon as you save and close the text editor.
If you write an invalid setting or delete an entry it gets reset to the default value.

## Resources and Performance

LeagueRecord takes up ~70MB of your disk space with most of that coming from the libobs dependency.

On a system with a Ryzen 3600 CPU and RX5700 GPU these are the performance numbers measured with Windows Taskmanager.

|                             |  CPU  |   RAM  |  GPU  |
| --------------------------- |:-----:|:------:|:-----:|
| idle                        |   ~0% |   ~5MB |    0% |
| record                      |   ~3% |  ~50MB |   ~4% |
| watch recording             | ~2.5% | ~160MB | ~2.5% |

The high RAM usage when watching a recording is due to using a WebView2 Window for the UI, which basically is a Chromium version that is pre-installed on most windows PCs. UIs are easy to make with HTML + some CSS. It also keeps the program size small and the common case - running hidden in the taskbar - efficient.

This is just a rough estimate with the default settings so you can get a sense for how much resources LeagueRecord uses.

## Release / Build

There is a release for Windows-x64, but you can build the project on your own.

You need the cargo tauri CLI: `cargo install tauri`, [NPM](https://nodejs.org/en) and the nightly Rust toolchain `rustup toolchain install nightly`.

Build the project with `cargo tauri build` to create an msi installer.
In order to pack the compiles files into a standalone archive, run the following commands after a successful `cargo tauri build`:

```bash
tar -cvzf LeagueRecord.tar.gz -C ./target/release/ ./licenses/ ./libobs/ ./LeagueRecord.exe
```

or

```bash
cd target/release
7z a -tzip LeagueRecord.zip ./licenses/ ./libobs/ ./LeagueRecord.exe
```
